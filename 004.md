# WordPress and AMP

In this meetup, Caspar H√ºbinger ([@glueckpress](https://twitter.com/glueckpress)) introduced the [Accelerated Mobile Pages project](https://www.ampproject.org/) and its ties to WordPress. As an active promoter of the Open Web, WordPress has been an early adopter of the AMP project on a large scale.

The talk‚Äôs purpose was to offer perspective for an open discussion on whether, why, and how WordPress developers and users could benefit from AMP, particularly in relation with the upcoming Gutenberg editor, as a framework to achieve rich content experiences with performance best practices built right in.

### Why AMP in WordPress?

#### [whatwebcando.today](https://whatwebcando.today/)

- Modern web applications can do most of the things native apps can do.
- ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve hit peak WordPress‚Äù: WordPress has become a tool amongst other tools in the publishing stack.
- WordPress holds back adoption of modern standards and best practices for ‚Äú[31% of the web](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all)‚Äù.


### #ProgressiveWP

- Implement coding and performance best practices
- Encourage modern development workflows
- Support modern Web APIs (e.g. Service Workers)
- Enable progressive web applications (PWA)
- Create user-first experiences

> ‚ÄúWe must strive to close‚Ä® the Capability/Usage gap ‚Ä¶‚Ä®to democratise the building of delightful user experiences on the web.‚Äù
> ‚Äî[Alberto Medina](https://medinathoughts.com/2018/05/17/progressive-wordpress/)


> ‚ÄúHow much should [people] need to know about‚Ä®how the web works‚Ä®in order to be able to‚Ä®publish some content?‚Äù
> ‚Äî[Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://youtu.be/UQlRiyOvmns?t=4m35s)


> ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs also about limiting what a theme can do, ‚Ä¶ And that‚Äôs where AMP comes into the picture.‚Äù
> ‚Äî[Weston Ruter](https://youtu.be/UQlRiyOvmns?t=3m0s)


Progressive WordPress is all about moving WordPress from the ‚Äúcave in the desert‚Äù to the ‚Äúspaceship‚Äù‚Äîjust by using it to publish content.


### #Gutenberg

> ‚ÄúEverything is a block.‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúThe ‚Ä¶ goal of Gutenberg is to create a post and page building experience that makes it easy to create¬†rich post layouts.‚Äù
> ‚Äî[Gutenberg design principles](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/design-principles/)


#### If everything is a block, how do we make sure blocks don‚Äôt suck?

History has shown again and again and again: You give people a new tool, they end up using it in irresponsible ways. Not because people are evil, or want to do evil things. But because many people are either ignorant, or uneducated in what they need to know to use a new tool responsibly.

If we give people blocks, it‚Äôs our responsibility to make sure those blocks won‚Äôt suck the life out of 31% of the web.

And this is where AMP could play an important role.
The very purpose of AMP is to ‚Äúun-suck‚Äù user experience under realisitc (i.e. less than privileged) conditions. By letting AMP handle what themes and plugins print on the front-end, the _rich post layouts_ promised by Gutenberg could make for an excellent, user-first, fast and reliable experience by default.

[AMP Stories](https://www.ampproject.org/stories/), for example, provide safe access to rich story telling‚Äîsafe in the sense that it‚Äôs much, much harder to screw them up in terms of performance and UX.


### Wrap up

WordPress and AMP‚Äîthe pros:

- A front-end library and caching infrastructure to complement Gutenberg blocks
- A safe, responsible way to enable rich post layouts
- A time-saver for developers and site builders
- A lever for WP businesses to sell the performance
- A toolbox to ensure performant, delightful UX across the WordPress product ecosystem
- A relationship the entire web can benefit from

WordPress and AMP‚Äîconcerns:

- A corporation hijacking a community?
- A monopoly on the rise?
- A new chapter of browser wars?
- A fist in the face of open Web Standards?
- A fig-leaf to the fact WP lacks a front-end culture?
- A nail in the coffin of WP as a community project?
