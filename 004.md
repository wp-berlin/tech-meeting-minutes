# WordPress &amp; AMP

In this meetup, Caspar HÃ¼binger ([@glueckpress](https://twitter.com/glueckpress)) introduced the [Accelerated Mobile Pages project](https://www.ampproject.org/) and its ties to WordPress. As an active promoter of the Open Web, WordPress has been an early adopter of the AMP project on a large scale.
